            <h2>Our Patron</h2>
            <p>
                Michael, also called Saint Michael the Archangel, Saint Michael the Taxiarch in Orthodoxy and Archangel Michael is an archangel in Judaism, Christianity, Islam and the Baha'i faith. The earliest surviving mentions of his name are in 3rd- and 2nd-century BC Jewish works, often but not always apocalyptic, where he is the chief of the angels and archangels and he is the guardian prince of Israel and is responsible for the care of Israel. Christianity adopted nearly all the Jewish traditions concerning him, and he is mentioned explicitly in Revelation 12:7–12, where he does battle with Satan, and in the Epistle of Jude, where the author denounces heretics by contrasting them with Michael.He is our protector and he protects us from all evil.

            <h2>Our Founder</h2>
            <p>
                The Servant of God Raymond Francis Camillus Mascarenhas was born in Shivamogga on 23rd January 1875 and was baptized on 27th of the same month at the Sacred Heart Church,  Shivamogga. He was the seventh among the 13 children of Lazarus and Joanna. One could perceive that this was an exceptional child, destined for great things, and pioneering works. In his school career and the seminary which he joined at 16 he has left brilliant record of his intellectual acumen. He was ordained priest at the age of 25 for the Diocese of Mangalore on March, 1900.

A man of vision, her read the signs of the times and worked to meet challenges present and future, in the Church and society. A man of holiness he worked for the spiritual welfare of his people. An eminent speaker gifted with a sharp memory and eloquence, he preached impressive sermons and gave eloquent speeches and was called the Bossuet of Mangalore. His passion for the word of God led him to translate the entire New Testament into Konkany and made it available to the ordinary people. He has authored also other books on spirituality.

He served the Church as parish priest in Udyavar from 1903 to 1910 and Agrar from 1910 to t0 1914, and the newly carved out parish of Bendur for 17 years from 1914 to 1931. As a zealous pastor he worked to meet the spiritual, intellectual and even material needs of his people. The two church edifices he built at Udyavar and Bendur, and several schools speak volumes about his zeal for God’s glory and welfare of humanity. His service as Vicar General of the Diocese of Mangalore and Vice President of the Catholic Board of Education is laudable.

Among his pioneering works, his ‘Magnus Opus’ the Congregation of the Sisters of the Little Flower of Bethany, to serve the cause of the poor and marginalized has won him laurels and has rendered his memory immortal. The Sisters of this Congregation serve in three continents – Asia, Europe and Africa in 176 communities and many centres, and work for the uplift of the least and the  lost.

Having lived a life of holiness,  achieved through hard work, suffering an d sacrifice endured  for God and above all,  his trust and confidence in the Eucharistic Lord and Mother Marty, he rendered his immortal soul to his Maker on 23rd December 1960 at his residence.

            <h2>About Our School</h2>
            <p>Dandeli comes from the word “Dandakaranya” a thick forest situated on the banks of river Kali in Uttara Kannada Dist. There is a legend that the Pandavas lived in Dandeli during their exile. It is in this forest area that St. Michael’s convent and schools exists.
                It is at the expressed request of the West Coast Paper Mills, Indian Plywood Factory and the Electro Ferro Manganese Factory, the Bishop of Belgaum Rt. Rev. Dr. Michael Rodriguez approached Mother Macrina, the then Superior General of the Congregation of the Sisters of the Little Flower of Bethany, Mangalore to start an English medium school  at Dandeli.
                
                During that period the schools were less and the people felt that it was necessary to have a Convent School for educating their children. The industrial growth slowly attracted the people from other places to Dandeli in search of their livelihood and those people who had children were finding it difficult to educate them due to the lack of good English medium schools.  
                
                The Convent was formally opened on 6 June1962 in a rented room. Sr Lourdes one of the Founding members of Bethany was sent to St Michael’s Convent to help the students in the preparation for the Republic Day celebration. In 1963, the school brought up the first school day and the parents’ day. In 1969 the strength of the school rose to 694 with 12 qualified staff. In 1969 Bethany Educational Society opened Std. VIII, Fr Joseph Koimma being the first Headmaster of the High School.
                
                The High school was admitted to grant from the Government of Karnataka from 1974 onwards. In 1975 the High school classes were shifted to Ambewadi. The school was gradually well equipped and furnished and received first time recognition. The steady and continuous increase in number was amazing. In due time, the school was given permanent recognition too.
                
                The laborious and dedicated services of many sisters as Headmistress and teachers with the co-operation of parents and well-wishers brought excellent results. Students excelled in sports and co-curricular activities as well. The tireless and dedicated hard work of the sisters and teachers has now turned this school into an enviable centre of learning. Students learn creative methods, inventive skills like running streams. It gives new vitality and creativity. The institution will complete 50 years of service and it will be a golden day!</p>
